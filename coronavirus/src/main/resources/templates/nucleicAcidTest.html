                    <p>Name:Nucleic Acid Test.</p>
                    <p>Another name：Viral nucleic acid test, DNA/RNA test, throat swab test, nasopharyngeal swab test。</p>
                    <p>Department: All authorised clinical departments can be ordered for examination.</p>
                    <h2 searchId='0-2'>What is nucleic acid testing？</h2>
                    <p>Nucleic acids are the genetic material in living organisms, including deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA).</p>
                    <p>Nucleic acid detection refers to the use of biomedical technology and some special reagents to detect whether there is a certain genetic material in the human body to further determine whether the infection of pathogenic microorganisms.</p>
                    <p>In addition, nucleic acid detection is also used in the diagnosis and treatment of genetic diseases, tumor molecular typing and so on.</p>
                    <h2 searchId='0-3'>How does nucleic acid testing work？</h2>
                    <p>The most common method for nucleic acid detection is real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR technology (RT-PCR). Through real-time detection of the fluorescence signal changes in the PCR amplification reaction, quantitative and qualitative analysis of the nucleic acid concentration in the sample is realized. The fluorescence signal strength is proportional to the detected nucleic acid sequence.</p>
                    <h2 searchId='0-4'>How to collect samples for nucleic acid testing?</h2>
                    <p>According to different sampling paths, the common methods for clinical nucleic acid collection are mainly oral and nasopharyngeal swabs, which are suitable for most people. In addition, according to clinical needs, there are anal swabs, blood draws (serological) nucleic acid testing.</p>
                    <p>Compared with oropharyngeal swabs, nasopharyngeal swabs have a longer sampling time. In the detection of pathogens such as influenza and coronavirus, the positive rate of nasopharyngeal swabs is higher than that of oropharyngeal swabs, and the missed diagnosis rate is lower.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Nasopharyngeal test</strong></li>
                    </ol>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>First stabilize the head of the collector, the head is later tilted about 70°, the staff holds a long swab swab in one hand through the nostril, parallel to the roof of the nose, slowly deep along the bottom of the nasal canal, until the resistance is encountered or about equal to the distance from the outer mouth of the collector's ear to the nose.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>When it reaches the bottom of the nasopharynx, gently rub or rotate it for a few weeks and stay for a few seconds to absorb the secretions.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Then slowly remove the swab while rotating, and dip the swab head into a tube containing 2 to 3 mL of the virus preservation solution.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>If one nostril is blocked, or if the specimen is under-sampled, the same swab can be used to collect the specimen from the other nostril; However, if the first collection is sufficient, there is no need to collect the specimen from the other side.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                        <li><strong>Oropharyngeal test</strong></li>
                    </ol>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The operation is simple and it is commonly used in clinic.</li>
                        <li>The tested person first gargled with normal saline. During the examination, the head was slightly tilted, the mouth was wide open, and there was a "ah" sound. The collector would enter the swab from the mouth, and wipe it back and forth in the back of the pharynx and the tonsil area at least 3 times, while paying attention to avoid contact with the tongue, teeth and gums.</li>
                        <li>Then remove the swab, dip the swab head into the tube containing 2 to 3 mL of virus preservation solution, discard the tail, and tighten the tube cover.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ol start="3">
                        <li><strong>Anal test</strong>：</li>
                    </ol>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Collection method: The tester uses a cotton swab in the anus for sampling, or the tested person happens to have stool, and the stool specimen is sent for testing. Anal swab and throat swab test only different specimen collection site, other procedures are the same, can be produced within 12 hours or 24 hours results. </li>
                        <li> Suitable population: people who have been under centralized quarantine observation, people who are highly suspected in the fever clinic of the hospital, people with digestive tract symptoms, immigration personnel, close contact personnel and other key groups, at the same time to collect throat swabs and anal swabs. </li>
                        <li> Interpretation of the result: After the pharyngeal nucleic acid turns negative in many infected people, the anal swab test is still positive, and the positive duration is longer than that of the pharyngeal swab. </li>
                        <li> Advantages: The combination of throat swab and anal test can improve the detection rate and reduce the proportion of missed diagnosis. </li>
                        <li> Disadvantages: sampling is not convenient, and patients may have psychological embarrassment and other discomfort. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ol start="4">
                        <li><strong>Serological test</strong>：</li>
                    </ol>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Collection method: Collect 3 ~ 5 mL of venous blood from the elbow, centrifuge serum for detection after blood coagulation. </li>
                        <li> Suitable for the population: as a supplementary method for throat swab nucleic acid detection, to detect whether the body produces protective antibodies after vaccination against COVID-19. </li>
                        <li> Detection methods: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, chemiluminescence immunoassay, colloidal gold immunochromatography. The most widely used method is colloidal gold immunochromatography. </li>
                        <li> Result interpretation: After the patient is infected with the novel coronavirus, the positive antibody test indicates that the tested person is in the recovery period, or has been infected, or has been vaccinated, which needs to be combined with the nucleic acid test results to make a comprehensive analysis. </li>
                        <li> Advantages: convenient operation, rapid detection. When the nucleic acid test is negative, the IgM and IgG antibody test can be added to make up for the shortcomings of the nucleic acid test that is easy to cause missed diagnosis. The "Novel coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol (Trial Version 7)" clearly includes the antibody test results in the diagnostic criteria for confirmed cases and the exclusion criteria for suspected cases. </li>
                        <li> Disadvantages: The virus infection may not be detected in the early stage, and the infected person can not be found early. It can be used as a supplement to nucleic acid testing, but it cannot replace it. Due to methodological limitations, "false positive" and "false negative" antibody tests cannot be avoided and are not applicable to epidemiological investigations. </li>

                    <h2 searchId='0-5'> Which techniques are available for nucleic acid detection? </h2>
                    <p> After the nucleic acid specimen is collected, the next step is sent to the laboratory. Clinical laboratory through some complex biomedical technology and special reagents to detect whether there is a certain microbial genetic material, and then issue the results for clinical reference. </p>
                    <p> The main methods include real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (RT-PCR), loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and high-throughput sequencing (NGS), among which PCR is the most commonly used for its advantages of strong specificity, high sensitivity and accurate quantification. </p>
                    <p>NGS technology is particularly good at detecting unknown pathogens and has the advantages of direct and accurate, but its high cost, complex operation and long time cannot be applied in clinical large-scale. </p>
                    <h2 searchId='0-6'> What are the differences between mixed detection and single tube detection? </h2>
                    <p> Mixed detection refers to the sampling of multiple samples. Currently, the state recommends 10-in-1 mixed detection for COVID-19 detection, that is, 10 samples are continuously collected and mixed into the same detection tube for testing, so as to improve detection efficiency and reduce detection costs. If there are less than 10 swabs in the collection tube, special marks should be made and recorded. </p>
                    <p> The laboratory testing time of mixed sampling and single tube testing is the same, which does not affect the time of issuing the test report. </p>
                    <h2 searchId='0-7'> What if the mixed detection result is positive? </h2>
                    <p> If the mixed sample test results are negative, a negative report can be issued. </p>
                    <p> If the test result is positive, gray area, or a single target, the relevant department needs to be notified to temporarily isolate the 10 subjects of the mixed sampling tube separately, and re-collect the single tube swab for review. </p>
                    <p> Those who were positive in the single tube review were isolated according to regulations. </p>
                    <h2 searchId='0-8'> What is the general process of nucleic acid detection? </h2>
                    <p><strong> Open a list </strong> : If it is an ordinary patient, accompanying family members or healthy people want to get the nucleic acid test results, there are the following ways: </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li> Find an outpatient doctor (general outpatient doctors can be issued, it is recommended to find a department with fewer patients, so as not to wait too long) registration, find a doctor to issue a nucleic acid test, remember to prepare your ID card or medical card in advance. </li>
                        <li> Make an appointment to print the nucleic acid test form in the hospital self-service system (the outpatient hall in the hospital or the appointment platform of the respective hospitals). </li>
                        <li> If you are still not clear, you can call the hospital service hotline for consultation, or ask the staff in the outpatient hall and the window staff. </li>
                        <li> If you are a fever patient, remember to wear a mask before going out, avoid face-to-face communication with people, you can directly go to the hospital fever clinic to explain the situation, issue a check list. </li>
                        <li> It is best to go to a local hospital with a certain scale or an institution with inspection qualifications, some hospitals/institutions may not have relevant qualifications. In "clove doctor - outbreak map - < a href =" https://ncov.dxy.cn/ncovh5/view/pneumonia_detection "> nucleic acid detection < / a >" page can query to have an aptitude for testing institutions or hospitals. </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong> Sample book </strong> : The sampling personnel will check and record the identity information, and may collect human blood, sputum, secretions (nasal cavity, pharynx cavity), urine, stool and other specimens according to the needs of the examination. </p>
                    <p> Respiratory tract specimens should be collected for COVID-19 testing. Generally, upper respiratory tract specimens (nasopharyngeal swabs, etc., are preferred), and lower respiratory tract specimens (respiratory tract extracts, lavage fluid, deep sputum, etc.) should be collected for severe cases. </p>
                    <p><strong> Send sample </strong> : The collected nucleic acid test specimen needs to be placed in a sealed storage bag. For example, the COVID-19 nucleic acid test is placed in a "new coronavirus" labeled transfer box, which needs to be stored at 4 ° C, and is sent to the laboratory for inspection by special staff in time. </p>
                    <p><strong> Test </strong> : First set 56 ℃ / 30 minutes to kill the virus, and then extract the nucleic acid material of the virus, and put it into the automatic inspection instrument for computer detection (PCR technology). </p>
                    <p><strong> Out report </strong> : Issue a test report (positive or negative) according to the specificity of the fluorescence amplification curve and the result value. </p>
                    <p><strong> Take the report </strong> : I or my relatives according to the provisions of various medical institutions, in a specific place and within the effective time to retrieve the test report, or on the Internet to query the results (some places do not open the network query function). </p>
                    <h2 searchId='0-9'> How long does nucleic acid test result? </h2>
                    <p> Normal nucleic acid test is a working day can be a result, the tester can know the results on the same day or the next day, according to the test results decide whether to review again. </p>
                    <p> For the current COVID-19 nucleic acid test, fever outpatient and emergency patients can provide nucleic acid test results within 6 hours; For general outpatients, inpatients and accompanying staff, the results will be issued within 12 hours in principle; For people who are "willing to check", the results are generally issued within 24 hours. </p>
                    <h2 searchId='0-10'> How long is the nucleic acid test result valid? </h2>
                    <p> The validity of nucleic acid results varies from 72 hours to 7 days, depending on the requirements of each location. </p>
                    <h2 searchId='0-11'> Does a negative nucleic acid test mean no infection? </h2>
                    <p> A negative nucleic acid test result does not rule out viral infection, and it is necessary to rule out factors that may produce "false negatives", including: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> The disease course is too early and the sampling time is not appropriate; </li>
                        <li> Factors such as collection method, collection process, specimen type, submission, and testing reagents may all have an impact. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2 searchId='0-12'> Is a positive nucleic acid test definitely an infection? </h2>
                    <p> If the nucleic acid test result is positive, cross-contamination, reagent contamination, or laboratory environmental contamination should be ruled out first, and the final test report should be issued after review. Clinicians need to combine clinical symptoms and final reports to diagnose the disease. </p>
                    <p> If the simple test result is positive, the clinical said "asymptomatic infected person", in the end will not be sick, only time can tell us. However, "asymptomatic infected persons" are also infectious, so they need to be isolated and observed according to regulations. </p>
                    <h2 searchId='0-13'> Can a positive COVID-19 test confirm COVID-19? </h2>
                    <p> No. </p>
                    <p> The diagnosis of COVID-19 should be combined with the comprehensive judgment of epidemiological history, imaging examination and clinical manifestations. For example: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Whether there was a history of contact with patients infected with the novel coronavirus within 14 days before the onset of the disease, whether there was a history of travel or residence in the community where the cases were reported, whether there was contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the community where the cases were reported, and whether the disease was clustered; </li>
                        <li> whether it has CT imaging features of COVID-19; </li>
                        <li> COVID-19 related clinical manifestations such as fever and/or respiratory symptoms. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> Sometimes blood tests for novel coronavirus specific IgM and IgG antibodies may be used to assist diagnosis.

It can return to normal after that. </p>
                    <p> Pharyngeal swab collection is to insert a long swab into the mouth about the position of the pharyngeal wall. During the collection process, there may be a feeling of nausea and vomiting. Generally, there is no obvious discomfort after the collection is completed and relaxed. </p>
                    However, the detection feeling is also different from person to person, some people's reaction is obvious, the discomfort is very strong, some people's reaction is slight, and sometimes it is related to the manipulation. It is recommended to relax and divert attention as much as possible during the sampling process to reduce discomfort. </p>
